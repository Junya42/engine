# 3D Object Viewer Project

## Project Summary

In this project, I created a C++ application using the SFML library to develop a 3D object viewer. The viewer allows loading and rendering OBJ files in a 3D environment, with interactive controls for manipulation.

## Features Implemented

- Utilized SFML library for graphics and window management.
- Successfully loaded and rendered OBJ files.
- Created a virtual 3D environment for displaying objects.
- Implemented interactive controls for user interaction:
  - Arrow keys or mouse: Rotate the displayed meshes.
  - WASD keys: Move the meshes within the 3D space.
  - +/- keys or scroll wheel: Scale the size of the rendered objects.
  
## Technical Details

- Utilized C++ programming language for the application.
- Integrated the SFML library to handle graphics and window management.
- Implemented a file loading mechanism to load OBJ files.
- Utilized mathematical transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) to manipulate the position and appearance of the rendered meshes.

## How to Use

1. Compile the C++ code with the required SFML dependencies.
2. Launch the executable to open the 3D object viewer.
3. Load an OBJ file from the application's interface.
4. Interact with the loaded object using the provided controls: rotation, translation, and scaling.

## Achievements and Challenges

- Successfully integrated SFML and managed to render 3D objects in real-time.
- Implemented interactive controls to enhance user experience.
- Overcame challenges related to file loading, object manipulation, and rendering.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version provides basic functionality, potential future enhancements could include:
- Implementing more advanced shading techniques for realistic lighting.
- Adding support for additional 3D file formats.
- Implementing collision detection to interact with the objects.
