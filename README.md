# 3D Object Viewer Project

## Description

This C++ project utilizes SFML to create an application that loads OBJ files and displays them in a 3D environment. Users can interact with the rendered meshes, performing actions like rotation, translation, and scaling.

## Features

- Load and render OBJ files.
- Display meshes in a 3D environment.
- Interactive controls for rotation, translation, and scaling of meshes.

## Usage

1. Compile the source code using SFML.
2. Run the executable to load and view OBJ files in a 3D scene.
3. Use keyboard or mouse controls to manipulate the rendered meshes.

## Controls

- Arrow keys or mouse: Rotate the meshes.
- WASD keys: Move the meshes in the scene.
- +/- keys or scroll wheel: Scale the meshes.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome through issues and pull requests for improvements and additional features.

## Disclaimer

This project aims to provide a basic 3D object viewer using SFML and fundamental 3D transformations. It is not intended for advanced rendering or complex scenes.
